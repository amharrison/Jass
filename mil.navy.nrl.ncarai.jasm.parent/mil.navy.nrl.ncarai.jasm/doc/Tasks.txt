 - free standing cast statement: buffer as chunktype
   - wouldn't generate any productions, only manipulate the generation context (buffer content type)
   
 - validation if clear, no mapping
     
 - permit patterns to be defined globally or locally (w/in function). This would reduce clutter of the global space
   caused by function specific (goal) patterns. Should be relatively easy to implement
 
 - validate that the cast is valid
   
 - reward #

  x generator
  - support skip/stop?
  - test
      
 x support slot/buffer ref as request ala request retrieval(goal.slot)  or request imaginal(retrieval)  
  x validator : require cast for anything but pattern
  x fix highlighting
  x fix hovers for pattern
  x fix navigation
  x cast needs to be ID so we can cast to functions too
   x fix hover
   x fix navigation
  x infer contents
 
 - support {} block or mapping block in both handler and error handler for requests
 
 - validate function call 
 - validate insertion point (unique names w/in function)
 
 - improve validation of remove/request pairings
