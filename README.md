# Jass (formerly JASM)
The jACT-R Assembler is a high(er)-level language for [jACT-R](http://www.jact-r.org/), the Java implementation of [ACT-R](http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu). It provides an imperative programming model that compiles into productions for execution. You can [install](#installation) the binaries directly and go on to the [tutorial](#tutorial), or you can [build](#build) the software from scratch.

## Installation
JASM runs within the [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) IDE. 
1. [Download](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) and install the RCP/RAP version. 
2. Open the application.
3. Menu -> **Help** -> **Install New Software**

6. Select this [file](updateSites.xml) to import. **Apply and Close**
7. In the **Work with** dropdown menu, select **--All Available Sites--**. *It will take a few minutes to populate the menu with installable software*
8. Select all software under **jACT-R** <img src="images/install.png" width=400/>
9. Click **Next** to finalize the installation.

## Tutorial
The tutorial can be found [here](https://github.com/amharrison/Jass/tree/master/unit1). It follows the traditional ACT-R unit 1 tutorial for its examples.

## Build
Follow the installation instructions but do not install the JASM components in the final step. Import all of the *mil.navy.nrl.ncarai.jasm* packages from here. Use Maven to generate the source artifacts.
